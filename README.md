# Adult_income_analysis


In this study, we utilize the UCI Adult Census Salary dataset, which gathers demographic and employment-related information from the 1994 U.S. census.

The dataset comprises 15 variables, encompassing both numerical and categorical types, to capture a comprehensive snapshot of the American workforce during that time. The numerical variables include age, final weight (fnlwgt) representing the number of people in the U.S. someone symbolizes, education-num reflecting the total years of education, capital-gain and capital-loss indicating financial earnings or losses from investments outside of work, and hours-per-week detailing work hours. Categorical variables encompass workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native country, and salary, with the latter serving as the prediction target to determine if an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000.

The motivation behind analyzing this dataset stems from a desire to understand the critical factors influencing income levels and to identify potential biases in income distribution across different demographic groups, such as gender and race. Additionally, this analysis aims to detect workforce trends, such as variations in education level distributions across different occupations. By employing different techniques and algorithms in data science, this project seeks to predict whether an individual will earn more than $50,000 per year based on their attributes within the dataset. This investigation not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the economic and social dynamics of the 1990s American workforce but also enhances our knowledge of applying data science methodologies in real-world socioeconomic research.
